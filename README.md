# ChatBot

*A lab report by Chris Brownell*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

I added background video to the webpage and allow the user to toggle between "Chats Domino" and "Chat Stevens". They can un-mute the video to listen to the music, and have a bit of banter with the chat bot. Then at the end once the user has told the bot to stop performing, the bot forwards the user on to its friend "Chat Benatar".

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
